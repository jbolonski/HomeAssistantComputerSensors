# HomeAssistant Computer Sensors

This is something that I am playing with to create a .net core project that will use MQTT to automatically register and transmit sensors from a PC to Homeassisant.

I don't know if this will be useful or not but I am stuck at home thanks to 2020 and I can only play so many games.
